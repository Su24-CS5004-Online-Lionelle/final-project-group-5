### Test Details Pane

- Test Basic Functionality

Details Pane is blank at startup with a 'No Image Available' label in place of a movie poster. Once a movie in any list
is clicked, that movies' details populate in the Details Pane

![Apply Filters](TestResources/DetailsPane1.gif)

User inputted fields ('Watched' checkbox and 'My Rating') are not editable when a movie is not selected, but become 
editable once a movie is selected. Similarly, the 'Watched' checkbox is greyed out until a movie is selected

![Apply Filters](TestResources/DetailsPane2.gif)

Checking the 'Watched' checkbox updates the corresponding box in the List Pane

![Apply Filters](TestResources/DetailsPane4.gif)

Changes to the 'Watched' and 'My Rating' fields are saved and remain even if the app is closed and restarted

![Apply Filters](TestResources/DetailsPane3.gif)

### Test List Pane

- Test Basic Functionality

Clicking on a movie in the List Pane will trigger the Details Pane to display information for that movie. The table row
containing the clicked movie will also highlight

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane1.gif)

Clicking the 'Watched' checkbox in the List Pane will check the corresponding checkbox in the Details Pane

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane2.gif)

Clicking the header of any column (except for the 'Watchlist' column) will sort the table by the clicked column in
ascending order, and if clicked again will sort the table by that column in descending order

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane3.gif)

Clicking the 'Remove' button in the right-most column of a watchlist will remove that movie from that watchlist. This
change will persist after the app is closed and reopened

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane4.gif)

- Test 'All Movies' Source Tab

Clicking the '+/-' in the right-most column triggers a popup enabling users to add or remove movies from/to a watchlist
If a movie is already in a watchlist, then it will be checked in the popup menu. If a movie is not in a list, it will 
be unchecked in the popup menu.

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane7.gif)

Adding a movie to a watchlist will make that movie appear in that list. Removing a movie from a watchlist will make
that movie disappear from that list

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane8.gif)

When adding a movie, selecting 'Add To New Watchlist' will create a new tab with the user entered title of that
watchlist. The movie added to that list will appear in the new list

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane9.gif)

Attempting to add a new watchlist (using the Add To New Watchlist functionality when adding a movie) with the same name
as an existing watchlist will trigger a 'Watchlist already exists' (name clash) error

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane24.gif)


Upon startup watchlists are rearranged in alphabetical order (The 'All Movies' tab is always the first tab)

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane11.gif)

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane5.gif)

reverted

![Apply Filters](TestResources/ListPane6.gif)

If there are more tabs than the current window can display, a navigation arrow appears in the upper right hand corner of
the watchlist tabs. Clicking the arrow increments/decrements through the tabs displayed in the tab bar
