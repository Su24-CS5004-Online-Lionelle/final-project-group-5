### Application Description:

The Movie List Manager is a Java Swing app, powered by the OMDb movies API (https://www.omdbapi.com/), intended to
enable users to create and manage movie watchlists

With the Movie List Manager, users can:
- View, filter, sort and select movies from a source list
- Add or remove movies to/from any number of user created watchlists
- View movie details for any selected movie in any watchlist including the source list
- Record specific movies as 'Watched'
- Record personal ratings (from 1.0 - 10.0) for the movies that they have watched
- Delete watchlists
- Import watchlists from a file (JSON or CSV)
- Export watchlists to a file (XML, JSON, CSV or TXT)

All changes made to watchlists, including the 'All Movies' source list, are automatically saved, and persist from
session to session
